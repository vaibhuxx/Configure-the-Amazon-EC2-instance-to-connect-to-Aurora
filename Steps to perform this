**Connect to an Amazon EC2 Linux instance
In the AWS Management Console, choose the  Services menu. Choose Compute, and then choose EC2.

In the left navigation menu, choose Instances.

Next to the instance labelled Command Host, select the check box, and then choose Connect.

Note: If you do not see the Command Host instance, the lab is possibly still being provisioned, or you may be using another Region.

For Connect to instance, choose Session Manager.

Choose Connect to open a terminal window.

  Note: If the Connect button is not available, wait for a few minutes and try again.


**Configure the Amazon EC2 Linux instance to connect to Aurora

To configure the instance with the MariaDB client, run the following command. The MariaDB client is used to connect to the Aurora instance that you just created.

sudo yum install mariadb -y
Using a different browser tab, go back to the AWS Management Console. Choose the  Services menu. Choose Database, and then choose RDS.

In the left navigation menu, choose Databases.

Wait for aurora-instance-1 to display  Available.

Choose aurora.

Choose the Connectivity & security tab, and in the Endpoints section, copy the Endpoint name for the Writer instance to your text editor.

The endpoint should look similar to the following: aurora.cluster-cabcdefghijklm.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
In the following command, replace <endpoint_goes_here> with the endpoint that you copied to your text editor. 

mysql -u admin --password='admin123' -h <endpoint_goes_here>
Your command should look similar to the following:

mysql -u admin --password='admin123' -h mydbcluster.cluster-123456789012.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com

Return to the Session Manager browser tab that was used to connect to the Command Host. To connect to the Aurora instance, run the command you had copied in the previous step.

**Create a table and insert and query records
To list the available databases, run the following command.

SHOW DATABASES;
To switch to the world database that you created in Task 1 when you provisioned the Aurora instance, run the following command.

USE world;
To create a new table in the world database, run the following command.

CREATE TABLE `country` (
`Code` CHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
`Name` CHAR(52) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
`Continent` enum('Asia','Europe','North America','Africa','Oceania','Antarctica','South America') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Asia',
`Region` CHAR(26) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
`SurfaceArea` FLOAT(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0.00',
`IndepYear` SMALLINT(6) DEFAULT NULL,
`Population` INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0',
`LifeExpectancy` FLOAT(3,1) DEFAULT NULL,
`GNP` FLOAT(10,2) DEFAULT NULL,
`GNPOld` FLOAT(10,2) DEFAULT NULL,
`LocalName` CHAR(45) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
`GovernmentForm` CHAR(45) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
`Capital` INT(11) DEFAULT NULL,
`Code2` CHAR(2) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
PRIMARY KEY (`Code`)
);
To insert new records into the country table that you just created, run the following commands.

INSERT INTO `country` VALUES ('GAB','Gabon','Africa','Central Africa',267668.00,1960,1226000,50.1,5493.00,5279.00,'Le Gabon','Republic',902,'GA');

INSERT INTO `country` VALUES ('IRL','Ireland','Europe','British Islands',70273.00,1921,3775100,76.8,75921.00,73132.00,'Ireland/Ã‰ire','Republic',1447,'IE');

INSERT INTO `country` VALUES ('THA','Thailand','Asia','Southeast Asia',513115.00,1350,61399000,68.6,116416.00,153907.00,'Prathet Thai','Constitutional Monarchy',3320,'TH');

INSERT INTO `country` VALUES ('CRI','Costa Rica','North America','Central America',51100.00,1821,4023000,75.8,10226.00,9757.00,'Costa Rica','Republic',584,'CR');

To query the table, run the following SELECT statement.

SELECT * FROM country WHERE GNP > 35000 and Population > 10000000;
